# CustomerBillingSystem
This customer billing system for an electronic store is designed and implemented using the C language. The system offers a user-friendly interface that allows the store employees to create bills for customers, add and remove products from the inventory.
The project begins with the user selecting items to purchase.
Once the user has completed the cart, the backend team can access the server by entering the admin credentials and assisting the user in proceeding further, entering details about the user, and generating the total amount.
After the payment is successful, a text file in bill format is generated that contains all of the information from the date and time to the items and cost of the items purchased by the user.
This automates the billing system and provides users with a hassle-free experience.
The user can enter client information, which is client information. And when it is necessary to generate a bill for a client, simply create an invoice for the client. And the client was given a bill. When a client pays a bill, the invoice status changes to successful; otherwise, it remains pending.
